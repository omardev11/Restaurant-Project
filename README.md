# Restaurant Management System

## **Overview**
This project is a full-stack restaurant management system designed to handle various restaurant operations, including managing menus, employee information, customer registration, and order processing. The system combines a pre-designed front-end template with a custom-built back-end using C# and SQL Server.

## **Features**
### **Back-End**
- Built with **C#** and **SQL Server**.
- Implements a RESTful API to:
  - Retrieve menu and employee (chef) information.
  - Store customer details and orders in the database.
- Ensures secure customer login and registration processes.

### **Front-End**
- Based on a downloaded HTML/CSS template, customized to:
  - Dynamically render menu items and chefs' information using JavaScript.
  - Display order data retrieved from the API.
  - Handle user interactions for placing orders and logging in/registering.
- Adjustments include adding JavaScript functions and integrating the front-end with the RESTful API.

## **Key Functionalities**
1. **Menu Management**:
   - The menu is dynamically loaded from the back-end API into the front-end.
2. **Order Processing**:
   - Registered customers can place orders, which are then stored in the SQL Server database.
3. **User Management**:
   - Customers can register and log in, with their information stored securely in the database.
4. **Employee Management**:
   - Displays employee (chef) data retrieved from the back-end.

## **Installation**
### Prerequisites
- Visual Studio
- Visual code
- SQL Server
- A web browser

## Acknowledgment
The front-end template used in this project was downloaded and modified to suit the system's needs. All dynamic functionality, API integration, and database connectivity were developed from scratch.
